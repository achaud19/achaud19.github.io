      <a>How it Works</a>
    </div>
    <div class="howitworks1">
      <br />
      <a>
        <b>1. Research and Planning:</b> The first step is to research and
        explore the different packages offered by AirSpace. Our website provides
        detailed information about the different trips we offer, including the
        cost, duration, and what's included.
        <br />
        2. <b>Booking and Payment:</b> Once you have decided on a package, you
        can book your trip and make the payment through our secure online
        booking system.
        <br />
        3. <b>Training and Preparation:</b> Before your trip, you will need to
        complete a series of training and preparation sessions. These sessions
        will include physical and mental conditioning, as well as training on
        the equipment and technology you will be using during your trip.
        <br />
        4. <b>Pre-flight Medical Exam:</b> Before the trip, you will need to
        pass a pre-flight medical examination to ensure that you are fit to
        travel to space.
        <br />
        5. <b>Launch and Recovery:</b> The day of your trip, you will be
        transported to the launch site where you will board the spacecraft and
        embark on your journey. Upon your return to Earth, you will go through
        the recovery process which includes a debriefing and re-adaptation to
        Earth's gravity.
        <br />
        6. <b>Post-flight Support:</b> After your trip, our team will be
        available to provide you with support and assistance as you adjust to
        being back on Earth. We will also provide you with a comprehensive trip
        report and memories of your journey in the form of videos, photos and
        other materials.
        <br />
        Throughout the entire process, our team will be available to answer any
        questions and provide support. We strive to make your space travel
        experience as safe, seamless, and enjoyable as possible.</a
