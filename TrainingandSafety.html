        <b>Training Program:</b><br>
        Our training program is specifically designed to prepare customers for the unique challenges of space travel. The program covers a wide range of topics including spacecraft systems, emergency procedures, and zero gravity adaptation. Each customer will receive hands-on training with our state-of-the-art simulators, allowing them to practice and become familiar with the spacecraft before their actual flight. Additionally, customers will be trained in the use of space suits, which are essential for performing spacewalks and other activities outside of the spacecraft.

        <b>Medical Requirements:</b><br>To ensure the safety and well-being of our customers, we have certain medical requirements in place. Before the trip, all customers will be required to undergo a comprehensive physical and mental examination, and provide a medical history. We will also require customers to complete a fitness test to ensure they are able to handle the physical demands of space travel. Customers with certain medical conditions may not be able to take the trip.

        <b>Risk Disclaimer:</b><br>Space travel is inherently risky and customers should be aware that there is always a risk of injury or death associated with space travel. Before their trip, customers will be required to sign a waiver acknowledging the risks involved in space travel. This is a standard practice in the space tourism industry, and it is important for customers to understand and accept the risks before embarking on their journey.
